Virtual Plants is a joint research team between Inria, Cirad and Inra.  
We develop computational models of plant development to understand the physical and biological principles that drive the development of plant branching systems and organs.

OpenAleaLab is a multiparadigm modelling environnement for plants.
It will permit to divide the modellerâ€™s work into multiple tasks. Each task can be viewed as a virtual experiment.
OpenAleaLab is based on `OpenAlea Library <http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr>`_.
