Reversed domain name
--------------------

It uses reversed domain name to avoid conflicts.
For example :

  - name: fr.inria.team.virtualplants.myobject
  - or: fr/inria/team/virtualplants/myobject

URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
---------------------------------

  - https://team.inria.fr/virtualplants/uri#myobject

Generally these addresses are abbreviated using prefixes :

.. code-block:: text

  prefix virtualplant "https://team.inria.fr/virtualplants/uri#"
  virtualplant:myobject

.. warning::

    Though this name is very similar to a classical URL, it is only a name, that
    means it may not physically exists.
